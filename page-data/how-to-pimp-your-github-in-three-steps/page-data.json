Create a repository named after you</h2>\n<p>The first step is to create a <a href=\"https://github.com/new\" title=\"https://github.com/new\">new repository</a> that is named after your GitHub username.</p>\n<p>You will see this message confirming that you are creating the special repository needed for this tutorial.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danilo-delbusso/blog/master/content/blog/how-to-pimp-your-github-in-three-steps/github-message.png\"></p>\n<h2>2. Create your animated GIF</h2>\n<p>Here is where your creativity can shine. I suggest you make a GIF which will show on your profile page.</p>\n<p>You can create whatever you want. What I have found easiest is to design a quick HTML page with a welcome text and some CSS animations.</p>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://animista.net/\" title=\"https://animista.net/\">Animista</a> for my CSS animations.</p>\n<p>Once you have built your webpage (you can check out the code for mine <a href=\"https://github.com/danilo-delbusso/danilo-delbusso/tree/master/html-animation\" title=\"https://github.com/danilo-delbusso/danilo-delbusso/tree/master/html-animation\">here</a>), you are ready to create your GIF.</p>\n<p>Download a screen-to-gif recording app and record your animations. I suggest to use <a href=\"https://github.com/phw/peek\" title=\"https://github.com/phw/peek\">peek</a> or <a href=\"https://www.screentogif.com/\" title=\"https://www.screentogif.com/\">ScreenToGif</a>.</p>\n<p>Remember to keep recording for at least 30 seconds after the animations are completed, to avoid looping.</p>\n<h2>3. Add the GIF to your profile</h2>\n<p>Once youâ€™re satisfied with your welcome message GIF, you are ready to add it to your profile page.</p>\n<p>Upload the GIF to the repository that you created in step 1 and modify the README.md file to include your welcome message.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of ways to do so. You can either add the GIF by referencing it as an absolute path like so:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"markdown\"><pre class=\"language-markdown\"><code class=\"language-markdown\"><span class=\"token url\">![<span class=\"token content\">Alt Text</span>](https://media.giphy.com/media/Ju7l5y9osyymQ/giphy.gif)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>You can also use some HTML to achieve the same result.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>img</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">src</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">'</span>https://path/to/animation.gif<span class=\"token punctuation\">'</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p><em>ðŸ’¡PRO TIP: you can wrap this <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;img /&gt;</code> tag in a <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;a&gt;</code> tag to make it a button!</em></p>\n<p>For more GIF customisation you can check out this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/uupaa/f77d2bcf4dc7a294d109\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/uupaa/f77d2bcf4dc7a294d109\">flavoured markdown GIF tutorial</a> on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Finally, commit your README.md and share it with everyone who will click!</p>\n<p>You can find my repository <a href=\"https://github.com/danilo-delbusso/danilo-delbusso\" title=\"https://github.com/danilo-delbusso/danilo-delbusso\">here</a>, with the HTML to generate a welcome message like mine.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Level Up Your Github Profile Page in 3 Easy Steps","date":"July 09, 2020","description":"Add a custom .gif to your profile to give it a bit of a buzz"},"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-pimp-your-github-in-three-steps/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/how-to-pimp-your-github-in-three-steps/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/binding-controls-with-database-using-MVVM/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Binding Controls With Oracle Database using MVVM Design Pattern in ASP.NET"}},"next":null}}}
